i'm lbs and ordered a small i don't know if it's just me but it's a huge pet peeve when the model in the photo is wearing something tucked in or posed weird then you get it and it fits differently because you couldn't see how it truly fit on the model based on the models photo i just didn't expect it to be so wide and boxy  to be fair it does look better tucked in with your hand on your hip like the model lol  nice quality the color was as expected the only other thing i don't like is the thickness of the shirt is something you'd wear in summer but the shirt sleeves are so tight on your armpits if you sweat even a little you're in trouble
i ordered a medium in this shirt reviews were all over the place as far as sizing i'm ' lbs and a medium fits well in the shoulders but the shirt in general is long in the body i gave it three stars because instead of one piece of fabric with green stripes and white this shirt is three different pieces of fabric sewed together from top to bottom it's kind of strange and the seams don't lay completely flat so it looks like a baby doll top i would not by another one of these shirts
i saw this shirt and loved the way it looked online so i purchased it and it arrived right on time and was exactly like i expected super soft and fits great i have already order one in the black stripes
good news first the shirt seems to be good quality the fabric is not too thin as is common in so many women's shirts but it isn't very flattering on me it looks really good on the model but more like a tent on me maybe i got the wrong size i usually wear medium and it ran big on me but i don't like the shirt well enough to exchange it for the small so i'm going to return it
i am going to love this shirt  it's super thin but the top is not see through the only part that is a little see through is the very bottom white part but not enough for me to have to wear a tank top under it i plan on buying more short sleeve and long sleeve options  i bought an xxl and it is the perfect fit on me i'm  lbs and '
fits great  i used their measurements as a guide  i've worn a few times so far and it is definitely well made you don't need to wear a tank under it also it is a little lower in the front and backvery flattering
i bought this for my girlfriend and she really likes it it fits loosely and the sizes are a little off from regular sizes but they have the dimensions and they were correct she is usually a medium size   pants and the small fit her as we expected it to happy with the purchase
i love this shirt  i am '‚Äù and lbs and i wear a size  pants i typically wear size medium in shirts but based on reviews here i bought the small and the small size fit me perfectly   it is such a nice soft cotton material with a great fit
ordered the xl i am ' lbs with a large chest and a mommy pooch and the shirt fits perfect it's loose but that's the style of the shirt love it and plan on ordering it in other colors
i typically wear a m l shirt depending on the brand but i had to order a small in this shirt and it's still a little baggy just make sure to order down  it's a very cute shirt and the material is soft very well made
the hemming is weird where the different fabrics meet together which makes the shirt look cheap but its still a cute shirt and i still wear it a lot
i received the shirt  it is cute and the medium fit well lbs broader shoulders  but it is not yunjey it is a different brand see photo giving it a  based on that  things that make you go hmmmmm
super boxy im ' and weigh  i ordered the medium and it is huge i'm not sure if it's worth exchanging or just returning it i like the idea of the shirt and maybe in the right size it would be cute but if you order too big it will be huge like a tent i would order down one size maybe two
really cute  i am lbs and bought a medium based on reviews but i am returning it for a small
i was really excited about this top because i love mixed patterns and colors but the top was a bit disappointing in person i thought the material was printed this way or that the seams between the panels would be small but this is not the case the seams are a bit bulky and one of them goes directly across the chest which wasn't cute on my ds the fit is very loose and boxy and looked cute with leggings but i just don't like the way the seams sit on my body
