update: when i wrote this review the price was the same for the pro 1000 and pro 1500 (including both the black and white pro 1000s) today the price for the pro 1500 nearly $20 more than it was when i wrote this review and currently close to $30 more than the pro 1000 [original review below] i bought this to replace a very new vitality it was a *huge* upgrade over the vitality but then i saw the pro 1500 and learned from oral-b that it's quite superior the pro 1000's specs are: - 1 cleaning mode: daily clean - 8800 oscillations per minute and 20000 pulsations per minute on the daily clean mode - a pressure sensor that's supposed to just stop the pulsations when it's triggered - a pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds and 3 times every 2 minutes - a nimh battery (old technology) - a battery life of 28 minutes (7 days 2 minutes per day 2 times per day) - a full recharge time of 22 hours - a green charge indicator led that blinks while charging but stays off when it's not charging - a red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on/off if the battery needs to be charged - the crossaction brush head the pro 1500's specs are: - 2 cleaning modes: daily clean and sensitive - 9900 oscillations per minute and 45000 pulsations per minute on the daily clean mode (these speeds are faster than any i've seen so far in the specs of any of oral-b's electric toothbrushes including the genius 8000 - they all seem to top out at 8800 oscillations per minute and 40000 pulsations per minute) - 7400 oscillations per minute and 33000 pulsations per minute on the sensitive mode - a pressure sensor using a red led that turns on when the pressure sensor is triggered - a pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds and 3 times every 2 minutes - a lithium ion battery - a battery life of 56 minutes (14 days 2 minute per day 2 times per day) - a full recharge time of 12 hours - a green charge indicator led that blinks while charging but stays off when it's not charging - a red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on/off if the battery needs to be charged - the crossaction brush head the vitality is extremely basic: - 1 cleaning mode: daily clean - 7600 oscillations per minute - a timer that hesitates the motor 3 times every 2 minutes - a nimh battery - a battery life of 20 minutes (5 days 2 minutes per day 2 times per day) - a full recharge time of 19 hours - no charge indicators or battery life indicators - mine came with the sensitive gum care brush head in comparison the vitality seems like a cheap generic electric toothbrush don't consider buying it when i upgraded to the pro 1000 it was amazing i wanted to burst at the seams and write an extremely rave review but then i learned about *and ordered* the oral-b pro 1500 after using it i can tell you that the pro 1500 is *far* better than the pro 1000 i honestly feel the pro 1000 should be discontinued and no one should ever buy it i mean really the pro 1500 is only $10 more right now and it destroys the pro 1000 i would have given the pro 1000 4 stars instead of just 3 if it had a lithium ion battery they charge faster and last longer without charging so yeah i am not sure i would recommend the pro 1000 if you can get the pro 1500 the pro 1500 is a much wiser purchase i'm *extremely* happy with mine it blows the pro 1000 out of the water
i have always used a manual toothbrush but my dentist recommended this so i gave it a try i have been using it for a few months now and my teeth are whiter and cleaner
i've had a sonic care for many years and it finally died my dentist recommended an oral-b instead so i thought sure i'll get one the price is much cheaper for the brush and the heads for the oral-b than for the super expensive sonic care but all i can say is - i got what a paid for this toothbrush is so loud i was not prepared for that it sounds like the motor is laboring to move all of the brushes the battery life is awful on this one i've got to plug it in every few days for about 30 hours to get a full charge i never had to do this with my last one i do like that the brush heads are inexpensive they go on easily and can interchange with other brushes in the series (might try a more expensive one in the line) i have slightly crooked teeth on the bottom and this toothbrush is doing a much better job cleaning those teeth than my old sonic care did
i've been using a sonicare for several years it recently died and i needed a new toothbrush so i went with this one i'm so glad i did i had a dental cleaning appointment yesterday and my hygienist asked what i was doing differently for my home care because my teeth looked cleaner than usual my dentist commented on how good my teeth health looked too i love this toothbrush and highly recommend it
i had an oral-b that lasted for a very long time but using this one made me realize how weak the old battery had gotten i like the 4 part timer as well it does 2 or 3 short pulse pauses basically you divide your mouth into upper left lower left upper right and lower right side and brush each part till the dzhut dzhut pulse then go to the next part when you have done all 4 areas it has 3 or 4 longer pause pulses to let you know you're done having it split this way encourages me to brush the full time rather than cutting it a little short if its only a single length timer i have noticed that if i leave the brush head on it and just stick it back on the charging base there is always a little toothpaste still in the housing for the brush that will run down the handle and leave that white toothpaste film but if i remove the brush head and keep it somewhere else i don't have that problem
it’s great product i would recommend it however please be mindful of the voltage ratings my country normal home voltage are 230v ac since this is from the us the dock charger was rated at 110-130v ac i can charge it but it gets hot overtime would suggest the supplier / amazon to put a warning on this for shopper from overseas if i knew i probably would just get one near my local store instead
i've had this product for months now i've replaced the brush head twice for some reason the smell is awful it's as though there is moldy residue accumulating inside the brush head i've tried drying it out separately washing thoroughly after each usei don't know what the deal is but it's pretty gross brush heads should be replaced every 3 months or if the bristles are worn down and/or there is clear discoloration of the blue bristles so i'm not really sure what the problem is or how to get rid of the mold or smell otherwise i like the product heads up it is a very noisy device not silent like the prosonic devices
so far so good works as expected update: bought this because i was tired of changing batteriesa few months of use and now even after charging all day and through the night the red light comes on after a few seconda of use
i just received this electric toothbrush yesterday and it sounds like a jackhammer anyone else astounded at the noice it makes it woke up the whole family with its loud motor i’ve had electric toothbrushes for decades and never one that made this kind of noise
this product is horrible we used it for one charge and then have not been able to get it to recharge unfortunately i am unable to return this product as i no longer have original packaging if possible i wouldn't even give this product one star do not buy this item
